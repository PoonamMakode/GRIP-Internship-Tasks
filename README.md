# The Sparks Foundation Tasks

### This repository contains the tasks that I completed while working as an intern for The Sparks Foundation.

Internship Category - Data Science and Business Analytics
Internship Type - Work from Home
In this internship, we were provided a total of 6 Tasks and I was able to successfully complete all the 6 tasks within the given time-frame.

# Task1

## Prediction using Supervised ML

● Dataset : http://bit.ly/w-data

● Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.

● What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?

● This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.


# Task2

## Prediction using Unsupervised ML

● Dataset : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox

● From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.

# Task 3

## Exploratory Data Analysis

● Dataset: https://bit.ly/3i4rbWl

● What all business problems you can derive by exploring the data?

● Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’

● As a business manager, try to find out the weak areas where you can work to make more profit.

# Task 4

## Exploratory Data Analysis-Terrorism

● Dataset: https://bit.ly/2TK5Xn5

● Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘Global Terrorism’

● As a security/defense analyst, try to find out the hot zone of terrorism.

● What all security issues and insights you can derive by EDA?

# Task 5

## Exploratory Data Analysis - Sports

● Dataset:https://bit.ly/34SRn3b

● Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘Indian Premier League’

● As a sports analysts, find out the most successful teams, players and factors contributing win or loss of a team.

● Suggest teams or players a company should endorse for its products.


# Task 6

## Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm

● Dataset : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox

● Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.

● The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.


# Task 7

## Stock Market Prediction using Numerical and Textual Analysis

● Download textual (news) data from https://bit.ly/36fFPI6

● Objective: Create a hybrid model for stock price/performance prediction using numerical analysis of historical stock prices, and sentimental analysis of news headlines

● Stock to analyze and predict - SENSEX (S&P BSE SENSEX)

● Download historical stock prices from finance.yahoo.com


# Task 8

## Timeline Analysis : Covid-19

● Dataset: Daily updated .csv file on https://bit.ly/30d2gdi

● Create a storyboard showing spread of Covid-19 cases in your country or any region (Asia, Europe, BRICS etc) using Tableau, Power BI or SAP

● Use animation, timeline and annotations to create attractive and interactive dashboards and story

● Identify interesting patterns and possible reasons helping Covid-19 spread with basic as well as advanced charts

● Screen-record the completed storyboard along with your audio explaining the charts and giving recommendations.
